                  My second project was to create an online shopping website prototype with the functionality to order products from a product page. The requirements were to create a prototype with a basket page, sign-in and sign-up pages as well as option to add or remove items from the basket. The task is to be done with Axure.

The requrirement was to add a few pages to my website with information about myself, the program and my projects. I added a contact form which I later made interactive and a navbar for different screens. The navbar for big screens was implemented in the beginning with HTML and CSS only and the small screen navbar was added after I learnt JavaScript. I had to use my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills to implement the task. I used my first JavaScript functions and jQuery in this project to make it interactive. I added jQuery plugin in the brand text to make it looks like it's been typed. I have also added code snippets to some of the code I've used in my projects.

                  <div class="text-holder">My task was to add JavaScript to the Netmatters website I've created earlier. The challenge was to add side navbar, sticky header, cookie pop-up and a slider for the hero images. I started with the header and added some JavaScript to make it stay on top. I added the same to the main navbar and added scroll down/up statement to make the page respond to user interaction. After that I added a jQuery plugin called owlCarousel to make my hero images change. I have also added some code to check if user has accepted the cookies and if not ask them to do so. The last and most important part of this task was to create a side navbar for different screen sizes that appears on click on the burger icon.
